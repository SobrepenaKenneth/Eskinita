# The Weavers of Dusk

Concept By: Kyle Acosta 

In the coastal town of Himbing Bay where firefly trees illuminate the shoreline and time moves differently during the annual "Ghost Tide," 16-year-old Amihan discovers she can enter the "Pus√¥" (heart-space) of people by touching objects meaningful to them. Inside these emotional landscapes, memories appear as intricate woven patterns that can be unraveled or reinforced.

# Objectives
- Do the main menu
- rename the hx
- add some animation to the text
- add some transitions

- do the art
- attempt to add transition between Intro and IntroScreen

# Issues
- (A1) CrtShader also affect IntroScreen it should only be in Intro.hx
- (A2) it takes a while to compile that needs to be fixed
- (A3) zoom out and zoom in should take a while
- (A4) in Intro.hx what is supposed to do is it will zoom out and then zooms in the zoom out only works but the zoom in does not
- (A5) and instantly switch to the Intro Screen

# Fixes
