# The Weavers of Dusk

Concept By: Kyle Acosta 

In the coastal town of Himbing Bay where firefly trees illuminate the shoreline and time moves differently during the annual "Ghost Tide," 16-year-old Amihan discovers she can enter the "Pus√¥" (heart-space) of people by touching objects meaningful to them. Inside these emotional landscapes, memories appear as intricate woven patterns that can be unraveled or reinforced.
